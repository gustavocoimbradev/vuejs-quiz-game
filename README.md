## About the project

This is a True/False quiz game built with Vue 3 and styled using Tailwind CSS. Questions are fetched dynamically from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/), and the user can select a category before starting.

Everything is handled client-side, with no need for build tools — a pure HTML + Vue + Tailwind setup, great for practicing API integration, conditional rendering, and Vue reactivity.
